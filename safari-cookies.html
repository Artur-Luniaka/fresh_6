            <p>
              Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when
              you visit a website. They help websites remember information about
              your visit, such as your preferred language and other settings,
              which can make your next visit easier and more useful.

            <h3>How Safari Match Uses Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              We use cookies to enhance your gaming experience and provide you
              with a better service. Cookies help us understand how you use our
              game, remember your preferences, and improve our services.

            <h3>Types of Cookies We Use</h3>

            <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              These cookies are necessary for the game to function properly.
              They enable basic functions like page navigation, access to secure
              areas, and game functionality. The website cannot function
              properly without these cookies.
            </p>

            <h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              These cookies collect information about how visitors use the game,
              such as which pages are visited most often and if users get error
              messages. This information is used to improve how the game works.
            </p>

            <h4>Functionality Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              These cookies allow the game to remember choices you make (such as
              your username, language, or region) and provide enhanced, more
              personal features.
            </p>

            <h4>Analytics Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              We use analytics cookies to understand how visitors interact with
              our game. This helps us improve our services and provide a better
              user experience.
